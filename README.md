# Unit Circle Trigonometry Drill

A web-based trigonometry practice tool for learning exact values of sine and cosine functions at common angles.

## Features

- **Random Problem Generation**: Generates random trigonometry problems with common angles (0, π/6, π/4, π/3, π/2, π, 5π/6, 2π/3, 3π/4)
- **Answer Toggle**: Checkbox to show/hide exact values for all problems
- **Exact Values**: Displays precise mathematical answers (e.g., sin(π/4) = √2/2)
- **Responsive Layout**: Two-column grid layout for optimal viewing
- **Mathematical Notation**: Uses MathQuill for beautiful LaTeX rendering

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Click "Generate New Problems" to create a new set of random trigonometry problems
3. Check "Show Answers" to display the exact values for all problems
4. Practice by working through the problems and checking your answers

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Grid Layout)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- MathQuill (Mathematical notation rendering)
- jQuery
